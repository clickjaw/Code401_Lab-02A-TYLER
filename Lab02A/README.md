After completing the above, answer these questions and make sure you A-C-P them:

How long did it take you?

2 hours? Pretty useless for most of them till I deleted everything and wrote something that would work. 

What did you find most helpful?
Well, nothing really. In the time I had there wasn't a lot of reading that helped specifically. 
I still don't know how to use the methods in C# but I guess that's what our nights are for. 

What did you find least helpful?
Not knowing what to do wasn't very helpful, but I got the output. Even though the code isn't correct.
